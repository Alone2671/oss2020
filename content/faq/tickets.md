### What is your official statement on Covid 19?
We accept COVID-19 presents uncharted challenges, and whilst we have a comprehensive contingency plan, we will follow government advice, which is ‘business as usual’.

We embrace a duty of care to our community and will be working with Center Parcs to ensure good sanitation, medical cover, appropriate signage, and other appropriate measures. 

The UK Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, has informed the UK event industry that despite fears regarding the coronavirus, there is no reason to shut down events. 

We have no plans to postpone or cancel the Open Security Summit 2020.
