<!-- I find myself more and more in a role of a person, whose task is to guide you through the process of discovery. When you (or your company) are stuck, I can sit with you and teach you how to build situational awareness, how to find next possible actions, and ensure, that after the end of the process, you will walk away with a clear mind.  -->
