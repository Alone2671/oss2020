The Open Security Summit schedule is led by you. Have a burning topic that you'd like to discuss with your industry peers? Create a session and add it to the schedule.

The participant led model means that our schedule will remain fluid until a few days before the start of the summit, when we'll lock down sessions and rooms, to make sure everyone knows where they are going and when.
