## About This session
A quick fire look into where the information security and cyber defence risks are found across the capital agenda. We will discuss the approach to effective diligence and when in the deal lifecycle is it important to understand the risks. Whether you represent the buy-side or sell-side in a acquisition, merger, separation, carve-out, divestment or getting your business ready for sale, we will discuss what to look for to avoid any regulatory fines or possible brand damage.
