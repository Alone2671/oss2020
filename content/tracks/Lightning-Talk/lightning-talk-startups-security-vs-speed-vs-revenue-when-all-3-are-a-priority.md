## About this talk:

Since becoming a founder Haydn has had to balance a number of priorities that are often conflicting.

 - This talk will look at how security inevitably decreases a businesses speed and agility,

 - and how a tech startup prioritises security (an inevitable cost) against the speed and agility required to build a high growth business.

- Finally, the talk will look at how security can be used as a differentiator to win business, and how presenting your security posture to client security is a negotiation, not a pass/fail audit.
