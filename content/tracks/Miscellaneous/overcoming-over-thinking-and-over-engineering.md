## When designing an end to end solution, think about the customer

## Creating something simple is very difficult

## Overthinking/Over-engineering
* How do you define it?
* Does one follow another?
* Where does OT/OE end and becomes a requirement?
* Can OT/OE be a side-effect caused by something else? 
i.e.
	* Lack of experience. i.e. would you still choose starting with micro-services or plan for a may-not-be-needed distributed structure.
	* Lack of visibility on business goals, projects etc
	* Not able to keep up with ever growing buzzwords and products
	* Not able to define and understand not-so-technical concepts like bottlenecks or constraints, so fail to see/prevent them.
