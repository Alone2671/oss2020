This social session combines BYOC with AUA! Members of the JuiceShop
team will answer all your questions, listen to your ideas, praise and
complaints! As a warm-up we will present the results of
[the ongoing 2020 user survey](https://forms.gle/2Tr5m1pqnnesApxN8) with
graphs and diagrams as colorful as the participants' cocktails!

_Tip: There are no prerequisites for this session other than you should
have at least of OWASP Juice Shop! The Bring Your Own Cocktail (BYOC)
part is not mandatory to join, but it's more fun it you actually do._
