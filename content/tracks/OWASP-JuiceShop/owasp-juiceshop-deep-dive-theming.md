In this practical session we will dive into the **theming capabilities
of OWASP Juice Shop**. We'll not only update the shop with a new color
palette, but will also customize the product inventory, some challenges,
social links and more! Juice Shop can be fully tailored to your needs
and doing so will for example boost immersion in awareness trainings a
lot!

_Tip: If you are completely new to Juice Shop, best join the "OWASP
Juice Shop Introduction" training on either

at 17:00!_
