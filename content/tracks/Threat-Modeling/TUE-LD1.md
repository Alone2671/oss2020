## Why
When choosing a threat model tool, you first need to know what the tool can and cannot do. In order to facilitate this we are organising a number of demonstrations of tools, each 30 minutes long.

## What
Tool 1: Threat dragon.
OWASP Threat Dragon is a tool used to create threat model diagrams and to record possible threats and decide on their mitigations.

TD is both an online threat modelling web application and a desktop application. It includes system diagramming as well as a rule engine to auto-generate threats and their mitigations. The focus of TD is on great UX, a powerful rule engine and alignment with other development lifecycle tools.
