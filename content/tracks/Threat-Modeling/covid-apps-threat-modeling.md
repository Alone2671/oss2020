## Description

Covid-19 apps threat modeling session is a discussion on contact tracing mobile applications. The aim is to maximise the output number of potential threats and attack vectors by brainstorming abuser stories:
* who are the threat actors
* what are the key assets
* what are the threats
* what are the attack vectors / abuser stories
* potential mitigations and privacy-by-design approaches
