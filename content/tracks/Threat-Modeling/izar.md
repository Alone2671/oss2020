### Notable logs from the chat during the session 

14:24:16	 From Mario : I’ve been teaching both RTMP and LINDDUN GO with my customers  \
14:24:31	 From Mario : On the same sessions. Gives everyone vocabulary to discuss both problem spaces :) \
14:26:08	 From Mario : Agree with respect to LINDDUN, as it’s a “hard” modelling technique  
14:26:12	 From Mario : But LINDDUN GO is easier  \
14:26:31	 From Didar Gelici : because it is gamified?   \
14:26:58	 From Mario : yes, and the cards themselves have all the basic INFO to understand it and real world examples to make them clear  \

14:30:31	 From Avi Douglen : maybe an expansion pack... inapp DLC? \
14:34:17	 From Mario : An online game would be brilliant  \
14:34:28	 From Mario : someone should suggest that to Kym  \
14:34:52	 From Mario : She was kind enough to send me a deck of the actual cards  \

## Why
When choosing a threat model tool, you first need to know what the tool can and cannot do. In order to facilitate this we are organising a number of demonstrations of tools, each 30 minutes long.
