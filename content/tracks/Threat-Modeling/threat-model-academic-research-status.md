## Why
The industry and the academic environments do not often talk to each other. We need to learn what researchers are creating and the researching need feedback on what they should be looking for.

## What
Kim will go into LINDDUN GO (https://www.linddun.org/go) as a way to look into privacy related threats. She will also discuss how to use LINDDUN GO and will be asking for feedback from the community. 
Koen will present his paper on DFD and a paper on maturity of threat modeling.
