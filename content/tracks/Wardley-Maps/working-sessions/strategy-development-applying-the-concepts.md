## About this talk: 

In this talk we'll discuss  4 Problems for Cyber Security for the next Decade using Doctrine and Climatic patterns as the basis to discuss and develop potential solutions for it.
- The Communications problem
- The Management problem
- The Engineering problem
- The Skills and Structure problem

We will then break out into groups, to continue discussion on these and/or other problems and use Climatic Patterns and Doctrine to discuss and propose solutions for them.
