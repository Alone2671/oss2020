### During this Session we'll explore combing the principles of:
- Wardley Maps ; Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners
- Squads and Tribes
- Team Topologies  

In an attempt to explore effective organisational structure that aligns effectively with the systems being built.

## Why

Team designs are very important because good team designs lead to good software design and good software design leads to better more effective teams (or if you get it wrong the cycle goes the other way).
The factors that influence both a good architecture as well as good teams need to be considered when designing teams, team boundaries, and the planned communication required between teams.

## What

- Types of teams
- Types of work
- Types of people
- Information flow
- System design
- Team structure
- Direction of travel
- Cognitive load

## Outcomes

- Efficieny
- Focus
- Culture
- Value
- Delivery
