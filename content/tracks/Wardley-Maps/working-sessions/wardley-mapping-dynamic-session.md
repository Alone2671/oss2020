19:16:56     From  Mario Platt : https://medium.com/@marioplatt/   quantitative-risk-management-with-fair-stage-1-ransomware-scenario-d2e3a9d49b60  \
19:24:43     From  André Ferreira : Interesting diagram, sounds newish  \
19:24:54     From  Didar Gelici : and looks very good   \
19:25:10     From  Didar Gelici : would work very well for people like me, visual   \
19:25:20     From  André Ferreira : Makes sense   \
19:47:33     From  André Ferreira : Mario, I for one, and being devils advocate or printer friendly would avoid colours altogether
19:48:04     From  Avi Douglen : Andre the alternative would be different shapes?  \
19:48:06     From  André Ferreira : Like the different the different arrows  \
19:48:58     From  André Ferreira : I’m to new to this topic, but color blind people, printing, not a fan of putting colour
19:49:52     From  Avi Douglen : agree with visually impaired being an issue. but it does contain a LOT of information. so we'll need to find another option.  \
19:51:00     From  Felipe Zipitria : Sorry, need to drop for a call. Will catch up on youtube afterwards  \
19:51:09     From  André Ferreira : I understand the point, but thinking as a new person to this, so lets say, I’m a business person (MBA type of guy, familiar with loads of different matrixes), they will be annoyed if they can look at it and just get it. Ig you need to explain it further, they will fell dumb and dismiss it  \
19:51:27     From  André Ferreira : If the can/can't  \
19:59:33     From  Avi Douglen : sorry about that   \
20:17:49     From  André Ferreira : Colours here help Avi, go for it  \
20:21:05     From  Didar Gelici : is this available as a template on draw.io? or is this what you built on top of a template
20:21:12     From  Didar Gelici : @avi  \
20:21:47     From  André Ferreira : I like regions, but would like to see a problem there, agains their positioning on the lanes
20:22:50     From  Alona Reyes  to  Avi Douglen(Privately) : From Didar Gelici to Everyone:  08:21 PM  \
is this available as a template on draw.io? or is this what you built on top of a template  \
@avi  \
20:23:46     From  Sarah C : I think if the regions were left with intuitive names, with the drill down available to individual components. Impressive, with possibility to simplify \
20:24:46     From  Avi Douglen : @Didar there is a template for wardley maps on draw.io, but I did have to improve it a bit here. 
20:26:55     From  Luis Servin : @Mario, will you share the outcome?  \
20:26:55     From  Didar Gelici : thank you for confirming, I thought so :)  \
20:32:10     From  Sarah C : FYI the newish, but very secure data storage solution I talked about is www. deep.-secure.com
20:56:31     From  André Ferreira : Agree ye  \
                 From Mario Platt to Me:  08:33 PM Not sure what outcome there is here. This is literally a conversation ad exploration :) we’re not getting to any outcomes :)  \
21:01:18     From  Luis Servin : I meant  to ask @Avi whether he would share his wardley map
21:01:26     From  Luis Servin : I found it very interesting  \
21:01:59     From  Avi Douglen : @Luis I could, would just need to clean it up some more  \
21:02:06     From  Luis Servin : Mario's sabsa+two wardley Mario's would also be great to have and study in detail
21:02:26     From  Avi Douglen : and it is NOT a final approach :-)   \
21:03:37     From  Luis Servin : I understand it's not a final approach. I see it as a starting point \
21:04:03     From  Avi Douglen : yeah, haven't quite figured it all out yet, already know a bunch of stuff I would have changed
