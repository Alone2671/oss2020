## About this talk:
Planning, provisioning, and changing infrastructure are becoming vital to rapid cloud application development. Incorporating infrastructure-as-code into software development promotes transparency and immutability and helps prevent bad configurations upstream.

In this talk, we'll cover the current state of infrastructure security in the open source registries. From there we will continue to discuss best practices for writing, testing, and maintaining infrastructure at scale, keeping the infrastructure code secured using open source scanners. We will cover infrastructure security use cases like encryption, public facing data entities and plain text secrets, And will show how to find those using policy as code.
