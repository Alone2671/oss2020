### About this talk:
Planning, provisioning, and changing infrastructure are becoming vital to rapid cloud application development. Incorporating infrastructure-as-code into software development promotes transparency and immutability and helps prevent bad configurations upstream.

In this talk:

- We'll cover the current state of infrastructure security in the open source registries.

- From there we will continue to discuss best practices for writing, testing, and maintaining infrastructure at scale, keeping the infrastructure code secured using open source scanners. 

- We will cover infrastructure security use cases like encryption, public facing data entities and plain text secrets, And will show how to find those using policy as code.
