### About this talk
In this talk, Ill be looking at leveraging Python Test Automation Frameworks like Robot Framework and Gauge to perform easy-to-use and powerful AppSec Automation for SAST, DAST, SCA and pretty much anything else. 

I will be doing this live-code style (mostly). So do join in and let's do an interactive and exploratory journey on AppSec Automation with Python

** things you'll need to follow along **

* Python3 and pip installed and available on your machine (useful link: https://realpython.com/courses/installing-python-windows-macos-linux/)
* Visual Studio Code - I will be using Visual Studio code, but you can use an IDE/Text editor of your choice
* Sufficient privileges on your laptop/machine to install and run python libraries and code
