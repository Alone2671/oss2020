17:39:20	 From karenzapata : https://www.hunch.ly/     \
17:41:13	 From didymus : Buscador is real out of date. There is a walk through for a similar VM in his book.  \

17:57:39	 From didymus : Would you put all of these specific points of data into an actual file (like tattoos)? I'm just wondering how or if you balance what might be more or less relevant.    \

18:12:19	 From didymus : Are there  decent tools for "cloning" someones voice? Or "deepfake" video calls? I've read about some but I don't know if they actually are ready to use in this context yet. I *think* I've heard about them being used to phish CEOs but I cant remember the specific instance.    \
18:13:44	 From didymus : Yeah, Lyrebird looks like it requires minimal data.    \
18:13:58	 From didymus : https://www.descript.com/lyrebird-ai    \
18:14:53	 From didymus : Yeah, a lot of those indian phishers use a fake 2fa text to give credability    \

18:17:44	 From didymus : Are there any physical entry tools (like bypass or whatever) that you always carry or find to be the most important?   \

18:23:24	 From didymus : WallabyCurtis https://www.proxmark.com/    \
18:27:49	 From 名無し : What if you crack/hack Building Management System and you could create you own access card? Doest that work?
18:34:44	 From didymus : Why do you think the "suspicious activity" angle works so well?    \
18:35:50	 From didymus : (in phishing emails)   \
18:39:39	 From Apoorva : Any good online sources to check/practice phishing campaigns ?     \
18:47:31	 From Didar Gelici : #firstdayatwork   \
18:47:53	 From Didar Gelici : for good badge photos   \
18:47:59	 From Jemma Davis : On location settings for apps, if you select allow when using app, does that mean active use or sharing location even when app is running in the background?  \
18:52:51	 From didymus : what is an instance where youd use canary tokens in terms of subverting someones osint on you?
18:53:21	 From WallabyCurtis : Any suggestions other than catalogs for leaking disaddresses as leaks?   \
18:53:50	 From didymus : also, prepaid CCs that don't require signup   \
18:54:01	 From didymus : like Visa Vanilla   \
