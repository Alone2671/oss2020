### Notable logs from the chat during the session 

17:21:39	 From Jannik : Fun Fact: The Hacking Instructor was merged during last year's Open Security Summit :slightly_smiling_face:
17:36:48	 From Rusty : He's using this framework   \
17:36:49	 From Rusty : https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/releases/tag/v8.1.0   \
17:51:16	 From N/A : Bjorn (sorry no umlaut on my keyboard :) ) is there any official walkthrough with all vulnerabilities and how to exploit them?  \
I'm asking this because sometimes, due to lack of time all I want is to spin a juice shop container and test/train a particular vulnerability.

### About this talk:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/owasp-swag/master/projects/juice-shop/logos/custom/JuicyBot_MedicalMask.png)

In this **introduction session to OWASP Juice Shop**

- we will take a quick tour through the OWASP flagship project that
  claims to be "probably the most sophisticated vulnerable web
  application!"

- Starting with a "happy path" shopping tour we will then learn what
  security flaws lurk beneath the shiny web UI surface!
- You will also learn about the CTF support, hacking instructor scripts,
  tutorial mode, dos and don'ts and some technical background of the
  project!

_Note: The theming and integration capabilities as well as the
MultiJuicer project will only be covered very briefly, as they both have
their own user sessions during the main summit week!
