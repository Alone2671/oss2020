### About this talk:

In this session, we'll look at the ISGs (Inspection and Sanitization Guidance) published by the NSA.

These are standards established by the NSA. There is a ISG for each file type.

In this session, we'll also look at how to convert an ISG into a checklist.

Once in table/graph form, we can start to consume them progrematically
