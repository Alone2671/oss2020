Portable Document Format (PDF) is one of the most widely used file formats. In this session we're going to explore ISGs for PDF files which will include inspection and analysis on various elements and objects that are contained within the PDF file structure and how they can be a cause for concern for either hiding sensitive data or attempts to exploit a system.
