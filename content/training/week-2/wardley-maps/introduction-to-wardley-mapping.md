### Notable logs from the chat during the session 

00:40:47	Dinis Cruz:	For new joiners please go to https://app.mural.co/t/lef9577/m/lef9577/1591189249671/c2a9c9398609f702ea325e8f3375f3fbc5b50b3e    \
00:48:15	Avi Douglen:	Should evolution be measured by the industry standard, ie what possibly exists - or according to our own implementation / adoption of known standards?   \
01:02:48	Chris D:	https://doctrine.wardleymaps.com/    \
01:08:07	Avi Douglen:	would it make sense to have domain-specific doctrine? eg generic, always-useful security principles. and then compare yourself vs competitors on those doctrine?    \
01:09:37	WallabyCurtis:	That seems like it would be useful, for sure.    \
01:15:49	evanjones:	That seems to be argument that SAP (its a monolith stack) and utilise say micro services to interact with a core product such as SAP Core engine?    \
01:16:18	Kenneth Haugland:	Read the Strangler Pattern Martin Fowler regarding moving from monolith (sap with custom modifications)    \

### About this talk:

You will get hands on experience with Wardley Mapping, which is a technique for building situational awareness.

Unfortunately, I can describe what is it for in a reasonable number of words, so please watch this talk instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnFeIt-uaEc.
